Research Overview
=====
I have been doing research at the University of Florida since my freshman year. Here I will describe my most recent work.

My PI is Dr. Chunjing Jia. She is a professor at in the physics department here at UF. The research project is titled "Machine learning extension of S(r,t) in space and time". So far the project is nearing the end of its second year. I have been affiliated with it the entire time.

Research Focus
====
The main focus of the research is to train a machine learning neural network (NN) to extrapolate a 3D complex data set in a few dimensions. The data that we are working on extending is the dynamical correlation function S(r,t) for a XXZ spin half 1D Heisenberg chain. The data encode dynamical information about the chain. We want to extend this to get a better idea of the spectra S(k,w) of the chain, as the spectra reveals to us information about its material properties effectively. 

My Part
====
One of our collaborators had an idea to use neural networks to extend this type of data. After receiving the data, I was responsible for creating the machine learning model, running the analysis, producing the results, and creating the initial write-up. Along the way, my PI and some collaborators helped our project stay on track and produce sound results. While the project is definitely not done, we are happy to have finished our initial goal of extending the correlation function of this model with a primitive NN, and are moving to more powerful applications of AI towards harder models. Below is our some preliminary results.
