Research Overview
=====
I have been doing research at the University of Florida since my freshman year. Here I will describe my most recent work.

My PI is Dr. Chunjing Jia. She is a professor at in the physics department here at UF. The research project is titled "Machine learning extension of S(r,t) in space and time". So far the project is nearing the end of its second year. I have been affiliated with it the entire time.

Research Focus
====
The main focus of the research is to train a machine learning model (neural network) to extrapolate a 3D complex data set in a few dimensions. The data that we are working on extending is the dynamical correlation function S(r,t) for a XXZ spin half 1D Heisenberg chain. The data encode dynamical information about the chain. We want to extend this to get a better idea of the spectra S(k,w) of the chain, as the spectra reveals to us information about its material properties effectively.
