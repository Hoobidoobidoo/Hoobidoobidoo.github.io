About
======
In this webpage, you can find some details about myself and my academic life. 

My name is Hubert Pugzlys and I am a 4th year physics and math major at the University of Florida. I have been doing physics research for all four years of my undergraduate career. I plan to update this portfolio as I continue on this journey this year and into my graduate career. So far, you can see a summary of my accomplishments throughout the page as well as some more details about the work I have done in the past in my CV below.
